# WishList


The purpose of this wish list project is to share my concern and  so that I can not only test that my wish is indeed a "common" problem, but also serve and a mechanism to help connect with other developers who would like to collaborate.

If you are intested in working towards any of the following "wishes" please connect with me.


"Wishes"

Software Terminology Dictionary: We often use different names to mean the same things, I also sometimes struggle to come up with the right technical name to use in describing a system or solution. I recently came across this when I wrote "embedded host" as an application that embeds a webview inside it. Someone pointed to me that this we could just use the term hybrid app. I heard the term before, but it didnt strike me when I was writing the document. This lead to people misinterpreting the document and all hell broke loose. it would great if we can have a dictionary application for technical terms."

Software Project Structure: When working on a variety of software projects, there are a lot of conflicting opinions on proper folder structure, folder names, etc. For example, if you were building a Web App, how do you properly separate your client and server folder? How about when you need to prepare for production, where are the configs stored? For universal javascript, where do you put the shared code? What do you name it? It would be amazing if there was an application that had the most popular and upvoted project structures for any use case.
